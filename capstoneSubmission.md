3. Description of Project
A web app to allow interaction between the speaker and audience during a presentation. The goal is to give the presenter tools like polls, question queues, and live audience responses to make presentations more effective and easier to manage.

The speaker can upload a presentation created from another tool into the app, allowing it to be accessed through the cloud when needed. Interactions can be made ahead of time into specific slides or created live to get interaction from the audience. Listeners can scan a QR code or type in an alphanumeric code to join the presentation and participate in polls, ask questions, or give live feedback.

All tools and options are customizable to the presenters’ needs allowing for any combination of feedback and interaction from the audience.
